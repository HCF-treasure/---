Each database serves as a container, letting you easily organize multiple Notion pages in a single structure. In the screenshot below, every row of the table is a page within the database \"Docs.\" This gives you a birds' eye view of an entire collection of pages at once. When you need to dive deeper, each page in a database can be opened, revealing its detailed contents. Databases are pages themselvesBut wait - each database is also a page itself! This is powerful, because it allows you to move and nest databases alongside other content, just like any other page. Databases have propertiesTo help you organize all of the pages within a database, properties can be added to contextualize, label, and augment each individual item.You can then search, filter, and sort by these property values. Database views display the same content in different waysDatabases in Notion are not static. The set of pages within each database can be displayed in many different forms, or what we call views.In addition to table view, the contents of a database can be visualized as a list, board, calendar, gallery, or timeline - whatever makes the information the most useful.",

            "In this ArticleDatabases in Notion are collections of pages. Here, we'll introduce you to the general structure of a database, walk you through the different menus and options, and deep dive into how to open and edit pages within a database. \ud83d\uddc3ContentsA tour of databasesCreate a databaseFull page vs. inline databasesDuplicate a databaseAdd and open database pagesItem optionsCustomize database pagesCollaborating in a database\"Can edit content\" permission levelLock viewsThere are three things that make Notion databases unique:Every item is its own page: Every item you enter into your database is a Notion page. Open a database item to add more information in the form of text, images, and more, as you would with any other Notion page!You can customize properties: Add properties to contextualize, label, and augment any database item with things like dates, status, and links. Learn more about database properties here \u2192You can toggle between multiple views: Your data isn't limited to a table. Visualize the information in a database as a list, calendar, chart, and more \u2014 whatever makes the information most useful. Learn more about views, filters, and sorts here \u2192A tour of databasesEvery full page database has the same menus and sets of options. Here's a quick walkthrough. Views: Edit and switch between all the different views of your database. Depending on your screen size, you may have to open the dropdown next to your current view to see your other views.Add a new view: Add a new view to your database, with its own layout, filters and sorts. Depending on your screen size, you may have to open the dropdown next to your current view and select Add view.Filter menu: Apply filters based on property values. When you apply a filter to a database, only you can see it to start, but you can save them to the view for your entire shared team if you prefer!Sort menu: Sort your data by a property. Like filters, sorts are only visible to you by default, but you can make them visible to your whole team as well.Database search: Type in any word, whether it's in the name of a database item or in a property, and your database will only show items that fit that search query.\u2022\u2022\u2022 menu: Located at the top right of your database, this allows you to edit your view layout, grouping, properties, and more.Create a new database page: Click this to add a new page to your database. Depending on your screen size, this may appear as + or New. Open the dropdown next to this button to access and edit any database templates you've configured.Create a databasePlay To create a database in Notion, open a new or existing Notion page and type / followed by the type of database view you\u2019d like to start with, like table or board. When you create a database, you can start from scratch or pull in data from another part of your workspace.If you want to use the same properties or an existing view of a database, we suggest selecting an existing data source. Search for an existing database and then choose the one you'd like to use.If the information you're adding to the database doesn\u2019t exist anywhere else in your workspace, we suggest creating a new data source.Full page vs. inline databasesPlay Full page databasesFull page databases appear just like any other page in your sidebar.You can lock a full page database so that other people can't change properties and value options by selecting \u2022\u2022\u2022 at the top of your database \u2192 Lock database.To turn a full page database into an inline database, drag the database into another page in the sidebar, which will turn it into a subpage. Then navigate into the page, and select \u22ee\u22ee \u2192 Turn into inline.Inline databasesControls and menus for your inline database are hidden until you hover over it.You can expand an inline database to a full page database by selecting \u2921 at the top.You can turn an inline database into a full page database by clicking \u22ee\u22ee and dragging it into the sidebar as a top-level page.You can Delete, Duplicate, move, or copy the link to your inline database by selecting \u22ee\u22ee, which will appear on hover to the side.In your sidebar, your inline database will appear as a subpage of the page it's in.Duplicate a databaseYou can make a copy of a database. For inline databases:Hover over the database, then select \u22ee\u22ee.Select Duplicate. You can choose to Duplicate with content or, if you want to use the same database setup to organize other pages, Duplicate without content.For full pages:Click the \u2022\u2022\u2022 button in the top right.Select Duplicate. You can choose to Duplicate with content or, if you want to use the same database setup to organize other pages, Duplicate without content.Add and open database pagesEvery item in your database, whether it's a row in a table or a card on a board or calendar, is its own Notion page that you can build, format, and nest content in like any other page.To add database items:For all databases: Click the blue New button at the top right.For a table, list or board: Click + New at the bottom to add a new item.For a calendar: Click the + icon that appears when you hover over any day. This creates a new event on that day.For a gallery: Click the + New button in the empty card at the bottom of your gallery to add a new image frame right there.To open database items as pages:In tables, hover over your first column and click the\u00a0OPEN\u00a0button that appears.In lists, just click on the title of the item.In boards, calendars, and galleries, click anywhere on the card.Pages will always open in a peek preview. Click\u00a0\u2921\u00a0at the top left to view in full page mode. In this page, you'll see all your database properties at the top. Each row is one property, with a name, type, and a value. Click on the value to edit.Click the\u00a0\u22ee\u22ee that appears to the left of each property on hover in order to: drag it up or down, change the\u00a0Property type, rename it,\u00a0Duplicate\u00a0or\u00a0Delete\u00a0it.Underneath your properties is free page space, where you can add any type of content block, including sub-pages or an inline database.Because database items are pages, any other type of content you drag into a database (like bullets or to-do items), will automatically turn into pages.Item optionsRight click on an item to reveal a list of actions. Those actions include:Delete: Deletes the item from your database.Duplicate: Creates an exact copy of the item.Copy link: Copies an anchor link to that specific item to your clipboard.Rename: Lets you rename the page in your row without opening it.Move to: Lets you move the row to another workspace or page (where it will show up as a subpage).Edit property: Brings up a menu with all your table's properties. Click the one you want and then click the new value for it.Customize database pagesThe top section of any page in a Notion database can include several things: Properties\u00a0provide data about the page you're looking at, like project owner, due date, tags, and more.Comments\u00a0capture conversation between you and your teammates. You can use them to tag each other, ask questions, provide feedback and more.\u00a0Backlinks\u00a0indicate all the pages that link to the current page so you can easily navigate between them.As with everything in Notion, you can customize the look and feel of these components. To access these options:Click the\u00a0\u2022\u2022\u2022\u00a0at the top right of any Notion page in a database and select\u00a0Customize page. For\u00a0properties, you can use this menu to choose which property fields you want to show at the top of the page, and how. For each one, select from:Always show:\u00a0Nothing changes, you continue to see the property field.Hide when empty: \u00a0The property field will disappear from the top of your page if it has no value in it.Always hide:\u00a0The property field will not show up at the top of your page.You can also access the\u00a0Customize page\u00a0menu by clicking the\u00a0\u22ee\u22ee icon next to any property in the list at the top of your database page. This\u00a0\u22ee\u22ee icon can also be clicked and dragged up or down to reorder how properties are displayed on your page. Tip:\u00a0If you have a database with dozens of properties, hiding some properties is a great way to keep your pages clear. Note:\u00a0When you hide properties, they get aggregated in a single menu item at the bottom of the list. You can click this to easily show any hidden properties. For\u00a0backlinks, you can choose:Expanded: See all the pages that link to the current page listed in full.Show in popover: In case you don't want to see all the pages, you can choose to see just the number of backlinks. Click to open a popup displaying all the pages.Off:\u00a0 Just hide all backlinks entirely. For\u00a0comments, you can choose to show them:Expanded:\u00a0 Show the full conversation at the top of the page.Off: Hide comments on the page for a minimalist view. Collaborating in a databaseWhen using a database in a shared workspace, Notion has features in place to prevent accidental edits that could impact other teammates.\"Can edit content\" permission levelClick Share at the top of a database to see and manage all users' permission levels. Learn more about sharing and permissions here \u2192The Can edit content permission level is only found on\u00a0database pages, and allows users to:Create, edit, and delete pages within the database.Edit property values for those pages.Users with Can edit content permissions in a database will not be able to:Add, edit, or remove database properties or views.Change filters or sorts.Lock or unlock the database. Note: Users with Can edit content access will still be able to create linked databases and edit views, sorts, and filters in that linked database. Learn more about linked databases \u2192 Lock viewsFind this option in the\u00a0\u2022\u2022\u2022 menu at the very top right of the Notion window. Switch it on to prevent anyone from changing properties and views in your database. They'll still be able to edit the data it contains. Note that anyone with editing access can toggle this lock on or off at any time. This is helpful as a quick safeguard against accidental edits in a database that you'd like many people to be able to change structurally.

            "In this ArticleYou can view the same database in multiple ways, and switch back and forth between them depending on your needs. Within a view, you can add filters and sorts to easily categorize your content \ud83d\udcc1ContentsTypes of database viewsCreate and switch between viewsCustomize your database viewsLink to your database viewOpen pages asFiltersAdd a filterAdd an advanced filterSortsGroupsSearch your databaseFreeze columnTypes of database views There are six different ways to visualize your content within a database. Here's a high level overview of each layout:Table: Tables allow you to see your database pages as rows, with every property represented by a column.Board: This view groups your items by property. For example, you could use it as a Kanban board to move tasks from one status to another as you make progress on them.Timeline: Use your database to plot project milestones on a timeline so you can see when they\u2019re happening and how long they\u2019ll take to complete.Calendar: Calendar view displays your items based on their Date property.List: Lists are a very clean, minimal layout of your database items.Gallery: This view is useful for highlighting images. You can edit your gallery to show images contained in the Files & media property \u2014 otherwise, the gallery will show any content that the database page contains.Chart: This view visualizes your database items in a bar, line, or donut chart so you can easily analyze and report on the data.Create and switch between viewsWhen you first create a database, you'll need to choose the layout of the default view. After this, you can create a new view by selecting + next to your existing views. Depending on your screen size, you may have to open the dropdown next to your current view and select Add view.You can also provide others with information by giving your view a description. To do this:Select a view \u2192 Edit view. Select \u24d8 next to your view\u2019s name, then enter your description. When you hover over a view, you will see its description. You can reorder your views by dragging them. If you have a lot of views, you can select {#} more... next to your views to do this. In your sidebar, views show up as nested items inside any full page database. You can tell they are views because they'll have a\u00a0\u2022\u00a0to their left. Click on any view in your sidebar to jump right to it.Customize your database viewsWhen you\u2019re in a given view, click its name to rename, duplicate, delete, copy its link, or edit its components. You can also edit view components by clicking the\u00a0\u2022\u2022\u2022\u00a0at the top right of the database.Each view of the database has several components that you can customize:Layout: Choose how you want your database to be visually organized.Properties: Show or hide database properties for each view.Filters: Add criteria based on property values to show or hide data.Sorts: Sort by a property to change the order that pages are displayed in.Groups: Group your data by the values in a property.Link to your database viewYou can copy an anchor link to this specific view of your database so you can share it elsewhere.Click the \u2022\u2022\u2022 icon at the top right of your table.Click Copy link to {view} and the URL will copy to your clipboard so you can paste it.Open pages asWithin each view, you can choose how you'd like database pages to open. There are three options:Side peek: Open pages on the right side of the database. The rest of the database view continues to be interactive on the left.Center peek: Open pages in a focused, center modal.Full page: Open pages as full pages directly. To change the setting per view, click the \u2022\u2022\u2022 at the top right of your database, and open the Layout menu.Scroll down and change the Open pages in setting.Note: Table, Board, List & Timeline layouts will open pages in side peek by default. Gallery & Calendar layouts will open pages in center peek by default. FiltersNotion makes it easy to filter your database so it only displays the items that meet specified criteria, i.e. have (or don't have) certain properties. These filters can be as simple or complex as you like!Add a filterTo filter the entries you see in a database view:Click\u00a0Filter\u00a0at the top of your database.In the dropdown that appears, choose the property you'd like to filter by.This filter will now show up at the top of your database. Click the filter icon to see and edit all of the filters that have been applied to your database.Add another filter by clicking the filter icon. You can have as many filters as you'd like!Note: In a shared database, any changes you make to filters and sorts in views won\u2019t affect other people on the team until you click\u00a0Save for everyone. Add an advanced filterPlay You can create more specific database views and combine\u00a0AND\u00a0and\u00a0OR\u00a0logic by using filter groups. These can be nested up to three layers deep! Here's how:Click the filter icon at the top of your database \u2192 Add advanced filter.A new menu will pop up. Here, you can choose the properties that you'd like to filter by, and customize the AND\u00a0and\u00a0OR\u00a0logic of the advanced filter.In the example below, we're filtering the table view of our Roadmap so that all the entries have to meet the criteria that include both\u00a0AND\u00a0and\u00a0OR\u00a0logic. Tip: You can quickly turn a filter into a filter group by clicking the \u2022\u2022\u2022 to the right of the filter, and selecting\u00a0Add to advanced filter. SortsYou can sort your database so that items are displayed based on properties appearing in ascending or descending order.For example, you can order them based on priority, or last edited, or alphabetically.Click\u00a0\u21c5\u00a0at the top of your database.In the dropdown that appears, choose the property you'd like to sort by.This sort will now show up at the top of your database. Click to edit it.You can add as many sorts as you want, or remove them by clicking the\u00a0X\u00a0to their right.Change the order that multiple sorts are applied by dragging them up or down using\u00a0\u22ee\u22ee. Note: Different properties sort by different logic, depending on their value type.Text properties such as Name and Text sort alphabetically.Number properties sort numerically.For\u00a0Select\u00a0and\u00a0Multi-select\u00a0properties, you get to define what sorting order means. Click on the property, then drag options up or down to set the sort order. GroupsYou can group your database by different properties on your table to visualize them in different ways.Click the \u2022\u2022\u2022 menu and find Group. You can group by nearly any property type.The database will now group by values of that property. Each group includes a \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f to the left, so you can quickly hide groups and focus on what you need.You can sort your database groups by selecting Sort and choosing to sort manually or sort by the options provided (alphabetical, ascending, and more).Empty groups can also be hidden from view with the Hide empty groups toggle.Search your databaseYou can search for specific content in your database.Click \ud83d\udd0e at the top right and type the word(s) you're looking for in page titles or properties.You'll see your database change in real-time to only show the items that fit that criteria.Freeze columnIf you have a large database, it's probably tedious to keep moving back and forth between properties to compare their data.  Instead you can freeze one column, which will cause it to stay visible on the left side no matter where you scroll in the database.To freeze a column, click the name of the column and click Freeze up to column.To unfreeze a column, click the name of the column and click Unfreeze column.",

            "In this ArticleHave you ever wanted to connect the data between two tables? You're in luck! Notion's relation property is designed to help you express useful relationships between items in different databases \ud83d\udee0Jump to FAQsContentsWhat is a database relation?Example use casesCreate a relationTwo-way relationsView and remove related pagesDisplay options for relationsCustomize displayed properties for relationsRelate a database to itselfRollupsRollup typesAggregate rollupsWhat is a database relation?Let's say you have two databases for your theoretical business \ud83d\ude09One that tracks customersOne that tracks items purchasedYou want to know both which customers bought which items, as well as which items were purchased by which customers. This is a job for relations! In the two tables above, the columns labeled\u00a0\u2197 Items Purchased\u00a0and\u00a0\u2197 Customers\u00a0are relation properties, which can be added like any other\u00a0database property.Here, when you add an item bought into the\u00a0Customers\u00a0database, the customers who bought them automatically appear in the\u00a0\u2197 Customers\u00a0column in the\u00a0Items\u00a0database.Example use casesConnect your\u00a0database of restaurants\u00a0with your\u00a0database of neighborhoods\u00a0so you can see which restaurants are in which neighborhoods at a glance.Connect your database of meeting notes\u00a0with your\u00a0database of clients\u00a0to provide quick access to the notes relevant to each client.Connect your\u00a0database of tasks\u00a0with your\u00a0database of bigger projects\u00a0to understand how projects are broken down into tasks, and how tasks contribute to projects.Connect your\u00a0database of candidates\u00a0with your database of interviewers\u00a0to keep track of who interviewed whom.Create a relationTo relate two databases, you need two databases. So let's assume you've made the\u00a0Customers\u00a0and\u00a0Items\u00a0databases above for the purpose of this walkthrough.Add a new column/property to your\u00a0Customers\u00a0database and give it a name, like Items Purchased.Search for\u00a0Relation.Then, search for the database you want to create the relation with. You'll see a preview of the relation. In this case, we've created a relation from the Customer database to the Items database.Click the blue\u00a0Add relation\u00a0button to finalize the creation of the new relation property. Now when you click in a cell in this relation column, you'll bring up a menu where you can search for and choose items from the other database to add.For example, this is how you can add which clothes each customer bought.To add an item, click the name in the list. To delete an item, hover over and then click the \u2013 button on the right. Tip:\u00a0To change the database you're connecting to, re-select\u00a0Relation\u00a0as the property type for that particularly property. You'll be prompted to choose a new database. Two-way relationsRelations are created as one-way by default. But you can easily toggle on a corresponding relation in the destination database.With two-way relations, the edits work both ways! So if you add a customer to the\u00a0Items\u00a0database in the relation column, the change pops up in your\u00a0Customers\u00a0database.Follow the above instructions to create a new relation property.Click the toggle that says Show on [name of related database]. In our example, this says Show on Items DB.Give this corresponding relation a name.Below, you'll see a preview of the two-way relation. In this case, we've created a relation from the Customer database to the Items database, and a relation from the Items database to the Customer database.Click the blue\u00a0Add relation\u00a0button to finalize the creation of these two new relation properties. View and remove related pagesWhen you create a relation, you're essentially adding Notion pages stored in one database into the property field of another. These pages can be opened and edited like any other! Click on the page in the relation column. Then click on it again in the window that pops up.You can also remove any related page by hovering over and clicking the \u2013\u00a0at the right. You can choose to limit the number of pages that can be included in your relations property \u2013 with the option to select 1 page or to have No limit.If you select the option to limit it to 1 page, people using your database will only be able to select 1 page in the relation. This is especially useful for situations where only one page should be related to one another, for example - if only one order number should be associated with each purchase.Display options for relationsRelations can be displayed on pages in three different ways. To change the display:While on a database page, click on the relation. Click Show as and select one of the following:As property: The relation will be displayed at the top of the page, alongside all the page properties.As page section: The relation will be displayed right above the page body, as its own section. Best option if you want the relation to standout. Minimal: The relation will be display right above the page body, but with the content hidden. Note: If you want to change a relation from Minimal to another display, click \u2022\u2022\u2022 -> Customize page. Customize displayed properties for relationsWhen you set up a relation in your database, you can also choose to display certain properties of linked pages. For example, let\u2019s say you have a database of frequently asked questions at your company. Each FAQ has a relation to a page that further explains the answer to the question. You might want people to also be able to see the owner of each page, so they know who to reach out to with more questions. You can set your FAQ database up so that the owner is visible along with the relevant page!To do this:Open a page in a database that has a relation property.Click the field next to that property to link a page \u2192 click \u2022\u2022\u2022.In the menu that appears, drag the properties of the related database into or out of Shown in relation or Hidden in relation.Once you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll see your desired properties appear in the relation field. This will apply to all of the pages in your current database. Relate a database to itselfLet's say you want items in the same database to have relationships with each other. For example, you have a tasks database and you want each task to relate to other tasks.Start off by creating a new relation. Then search for and choose the database you're currently working in.You'll now see that the database is related to This database. Just as with relations between two databases, you can choose to make this a one-way relation or two-way relation.To make it a two-way relation, toggle on Separate properties. You'll see a second property show up.RollupsRollups help you aggregate data in your databases based on relations. Going back to our customers and items example above, let's say you wanted to know how much each customer spent based on what they bought.First, create the relation so you know who bought what.Add a new column/property and choose\u00a0Rollup\u00a0from the\u00a0Property type\u00a0menu. Give it a descriptive name. Clicking on any cell in the rollup column will bring up a new menu asking you for:The relation property you want to roll up.The property of those related pages you want to roll up.The calculation you want to apply to them.So, for our example, you'd choose to roll up the relation property\u00a0Items Purchased\u00a0and the\u00a0Price property within those pages. Then you'd choose\u00a0Sum\u00a0as the calculation.Doing this adds up the prices of each item related to a customer's name, giving you the total dollars they spent in your rollup column. Rollup typesThere are different calculations you can apply as a rollup. Here are all of them:Show original: This just shows all related pages in the same cell. It's the same as the relation property itself.Show unique values: This shows each unique value in the selected property for all related pages.Count all: Counts the total number of values in the selected property for all related pages.Count values: Counts the number of non-empty values in the selected property for all related pages.Count unique values: Counts the number of unique values in the selected property for all related pages.Count empty: Counts the number of related pages with an empty value for the property selected. So, if one item a customer bought didn't have a price and that was the property selected, the rollup column would say 1.Count not empty: Counts the number of related pages with assigned values for the property you selected.Percent empty: Shows the percentage of related pages with no value in the property you selected.Percent not empty: Shows the percentage of related pages with a value in the property you selected.These rollup calculations are only available for\u00a0Number\u00a0properties:Sum: Computes the sum of the numeric properties for related pages (like above).Average: Computes the average of the numeric properties for related pages.Median: Finds the median of the numeric properties for related pages.Min: Finds the lowest number in the numeric property for related pages.Max: Finds the highest number in the numeric property for related pages.Range: Computes the range between the highest and lowest numbers in the numeric property for related pages (Max -\u00a0Min).These rollup calculations are only available for\u00a0Date\u00a0properties:Earliest date: Finds the earliest date/time in the date property for all related pages.Latest date: Finds the latest date/time in the date property for all related pages.Date range: Computes the span of time between the latest and earliest dates in the date property for related pages.Aggregate rollupsIn both tables and boards, you can apply calculations to your rollup column to get a sense of sums, ranges, averages, etc. for your entire database.Let's say you want to find the total money spent by all customers in our example.At the bottom of your Customers table, under your rollup column, click\u00a0Calculate.Choose\u00a0Sum\u00a0to add all the values in that column together and get a grand total. FAQsCan I export or import relations?When you export a relational database as a CSV file, the relation properties will export as plain text URLs. For now, you can't re-import that CSV back into Notion to re-establish the relations with other databases.Can I duplicate a database with a relation?Yes, but the following will happen which can be kind of confusing:If you create a copy of the Customers database in the example above, you'll see a new relation property automatically appear in the Items database.This happens because relations sync two ways in Notion.

Automations consist of both triggers (the events that initiate the automation) and actions (the effect of the automation). Database automations are meant to help save you time and simplify your work, and can be very basic or more complex depending on your needs.Database automations can be used for many things, including:Assigning a task to a specific person when its status changes.Sending a Slack notification to a channel when a page is added to a database.Note:Database automations are available on paid plans on all platforms. Free plan users can create Slack notification automations and use, but not edit, existing automations in templates.Database automations can be created, edited, or deleted by anyone with full access to the database. Slack automations are the only exception. These can only be edited by the automation creator.Automations won\u2019t take action on any pages whose access is restricted. You can check and change page access in the share menu.Database automations can't be triggered by other automations. Button actions, however, can trigger database automations. For example:A recurring template automation will not trigger a database automation.A database automation creating a page in another database will not trigger a database automation.A user clicking a button that creates a page will trigger a database automation.

With the click of a button, actions can be taken on your database on your behalf. Learn more here \u2192 Database automation triggersAutomations can have one trigger or multiple triggers. When you set up an automation, you can decide whether the automation will take place When any of these occur or When all of these occur.Note: If you have multiple is edited triggers that must all occur for your automation to take place, those triggers need to happen within a small window of about three seconds. If they don\u2019t, your automation may not be triggered properly. To avoid this, you can:Create separate automations for each trigger.Use a more specific trigger than is edited, like is set to or contains. You can choose from two types of triggers: Page added or Property edited.If you choose a Property edited trigger, you can indicate which properties from your database will trigger the automation.For name, person, number, text, select, and relation properties, you can choose what kinds of edits made to that property will trigger an automation. For example, you might have a list of contacts in a Notion database and set up an automation where the trigger is a phone number starting with the numbers 732, and the action is that person\u2019s state being set to New Jersey.You can also have more than one condition for your trigger so that two or more things must be true for the automation to occur.Database automation actionsAutomations can take one action or multiple actions. You can choose from a variety of actions:Edit property will edit the properties of pages in the database you are currently in.Add page to will add a page to a database of your choosing, and edit the properties of that page.Edit pages in will edit pages and properties in a database of your choosing.Send notification to will send a notification to specific people in your Notion workspace.

Your existing formulas will be automatically migrated for this update and should behave the same. For more information, check out our guide:How to use Notion\u2019s new and improved formulas with your existing setups Notion\u2019s formula syntax might look familiar if you\u2019ve done any programming before! You\u2019ll choose functions (which accomplish different tasks) and inputs (data to manipulate). An output (the result) will be computed and displayed in the new formula property for every row in your database.For example, in this formula: dateSubtract(prop(\"Date\"), 14, \"days\")The function is dateSubtract()dateSubtract() takes in a date, number, and then a unit text, which can be \"days\", \"hours\", etc.The inputs are Date (property), 14 (number), and \"days\" (unit of time).The output will be a date representing 14 days before your Date property Formula editorNotion\u2019s formula editor contains several helper features to assist in writing formulas. The editor automatically provides suggestions of functions or properties based on what's in your formula.You can navigate this suggestions panel with up & down arrows and use Enter to accept a suggestion.Long formulas will wrap once you\u2019ve exceeded the width of the editor, but you can also use Shift + Enter to create a new line!To navigate between lines, you can use alt/option + up/down.If you open the formula editor from a database row, you'll see a live preview of the result of the formula for that row.Note that the result preview will not display line breaks, which can be added using \"\\n\" in the formula, e.g. \"Hello\" + \"\\n\" + \"World\"The editor will display errors and highlight the erroneous code, so you can better identify the source of issues.Formula data typesFormulas can manipulate and return different data types. Other property types are supported but their data type will be converted. TextFor example, \"Hello world\"NumberFor example, 1, -2.5Can be displayed using the formatting options of the Formula property (e.g. as a percentage, currency, or with a ring or bar).DateDisplays as a date with time (like August 29, 2023 1:33 PM) and can be reformatted to text using the dateFormat() function.Dates can be date ranges, which can be constructed using the dateRange() function.Dates cannot store seconds or milliseconds.PeopleYou can use name() or email() to retrieve data off any People types.Displays as people\u2019s names with their photos.Booleans Can be true or false.Displays as a filled or unfilled checkbox.PagesRepresents Notion pages, like relations.You can retrieve the properties of a given Notion page by using . on them!Displays as a rich page link with the page's icon.Lists (or arrays)Lists can hold items of any type, including more lists. Multi-select, People, Relation, and most Rollup properties will return list values.You can use list functions like at(), filter(), map() to manipulate lists.Use the includes() function to check whether these values contain a specific value instead of equality checks. Example: prop(\"Tags\").includes(\"Movie\")List items display comma-separated for texts, numbers, and dates. For people, checkboxes, and pages, they display space-separated.EmptyThe empty value is not displayed in the output of a formula property, but can be used in the computations themselves.You can check for emptyness on any piece of data with the empty() function.For example, toNumber(\"\") or parseDate(\"Not a date\") will return Empty.",

To do this:Open your database and select \u2022\u2022\u2022 at the top.Select Customize {your database's name}.Search for Sprints.Select Add next to Sprints.Select Turn on sprints.Sprint board and sprints databaseOnce you turn on sprints for your database, a few items will be created to help you track them. These will be accessible in your Notion sidebar, alongside the original database you used to set up sprints.The Sprint board is where you can track all of the tasks belonging to your current and future sprints, using a few different views:Current Sprint: Shows tasks in the current sprint.Sprint planning: Shows tasks in the current, next, and last sprint, as well as any tasks not yet assigned to a sprint.Backlog: Shows tasks not assigned to a sprint. The Sprints database will give you a general view of your current and future sprints. You can open any sprint's page to view the tasks within.

You'll be asked to confirm the dates of your next sprint and what you'd like to do with the incomplete tasks from your current sprint. You can move them to the next sprint, move them to your backlog, or keep them in the current sprint.Select Complete Sprint.Alternatively, you can seamlessly transition from one sprint to the next by setting sprints to automatically complete. Learn about how to set your sprints to automatically complete and begin below \u2192 When you complete a sprint:The status of your Current sprint will be changed to Last. Whichever sprint was currently assigned to Last, if there is one, will now be set to Past.The status of the Next sprint will be changed to Current.The tasks on the board will reflect the new Current sprint.The Next sprint will be created if none exists.Sprint settingsCustomize your sprints to fit your needs. To do this, go to your sprint board and select \u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2192 Customize {your database's name} \u2192 Sprints. From here, you can adjust the following:Duration: Choose how many weeks (from one to eight) you want each sprint to run for.Start on: Choose which day of the week you want your sprints to begin on. If you change this in the middle of an active sprint, the current sprint\u2019s dates will change. For example, if your sprints used to run for two weeks starting on Mondays, but you want your sprints to run for two weeks starting on Thursdays, your current sprint will run until two weeks after the upcoming Thursday, so that your next sprint can begin on Thursday as you indicated.Incomplete tasks: Choose what will happen to any incomplete tasks from your sprints. You can put them in the next sprint, move them to your backlog, or keep them in their original sprint.Automated sprints: Turn this on if you want sprints to complete automatically before the next one is automatically created and started.Turn off sprints: Choose this to turn off a sprint. Once you turn sprints off, your sprints database, sprint board, and relations between tasks and sprints will be permanently deleted. If you choose to turn sprints on again, you\u2019ll start with a brand new database, board, and relations.Note:You can\u2019t adjust the dates in your sprints database because these dates are either populated based on the settings above, or set when you manually complete a sprint.If you need to break your sprint cadence temporarily, like for the holidays, we suggest turning off automatic sprints and waiting until you\u2019re ready to resume your normal sprint cadence before starting your next sprint.

If your databases aren\u2019t feeling very fast when you use them, there are a few reasons why this might be happening, and a few ways you can make improvements.Things that can slow your database downNumber of pages: If your database has a ton of pages, it might be slower to load.Number of properties: The more visible properties your database has, the longer it might take to load.Complex sorts and filters: If your database has a sort or filter on properties like title, text, formula, or rollup, the logic behind it can make load times longer.Things you can do to speed up your database setupAvoid building too many databases into high-traffic pagesIf you have a large workspace, avoid having lots of inline databases, like dashboards, in high-traffic pages. The more simultaneously viewed databases, the more stress on your setup.Try housing each database in its own page first. Once you\u2019ve done that, if you\u2019d like all of the databases to be displayed in one page, you can:Type /linked in that page and select Linked view of a database to create a linked database.Create database views in this linked database and configure them to point to your desired source databases. Different database views can point to different source databases!When using a single linked database, only one database view is open at a time, and therefore only that one database is listening for updates. You should see an improvement in performance with this setup.Avoid complex reference chainsFormulas and rollups are extremely powerful, but the more complex they are, the slower your database may be. For example, a formula that depends on several other formulas that each depend on rollups may take longer to calculate.Minimize the number of filters and sorts on formulas and rollupsDatabases that are filtered and sorted on formula and rollup properties may take a bit longer to load.Filter on simple propertiesAdding filters based on simple properties such as select, multi-select, status, number, and date may improve the speed of your database. Even if you have complex filters, this may help by reducing the number of pages that need to be processed.Hide unnecessary propertiesIf some properties are less important in your database view, hiding them may improve responsiveness and interactivity.Delete any unused pagesWe suggest removing any unnecessary or duplicative pages from your database to keep it as simple and up-to-date as possible. If that\u2019s not an option for you, adding a filter on the Created time property to filter out old pages may significantly improve performance for very large databases.Learn more about databases to make sure you're using them in the best way for your specific needsOrganize information with databasesMore resources on databases",

To change your chart type:With your chart view open, select \u2022\u2022\u2022 at the top of your database.Select Vertical bar chart, Horizontal bar chart, Line chart, or Donut chart.Customize your bar or line chartNote:The X and Y axis configurations are only available for bar and line charts.Your X and Y axes won\u2019t be able to show rollups, buttons, unique IDs, files and media, or formulas resulting in a list of outputs. Certain formulas, like formulas based on relations and rollups and other complex formulas, may cause charts to take a little bit longer to load. The X and Y axes of your chart can be configured to show you what\u2019s most important. To configure your X axis:With your chart view open, select \u2022\u2022\u2022 at the top of your database.Under X axis, you can adjust the following:What to show: Choose the property that should be associated with your X axis. Let\u2019s say you want the X axis to show your tasks by status.Sort by: Choose how your data should be sorted. For example, you might want to sort by ascending status (going from to-do to complete). You can also control what\u2019s shown or hidden from your chart by selecting \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f next to any of the options under Visible groups. For example, you might choose to exclude any tasks marked as complete from your chart if you\u2019re only looking to visualize your in-progress tasks. Anything that\u2019s hidden will move to Hidden groups.Omit zero values: Depending on your setup, you may or may not see this option. Toggle this on or off depending on whether you want to include property values for which there are no associated items. For example, let\u2019s say you have a status for paused tasks. If there aren\u2019t any tasks in your database that are paused, you can toggle Omit zero values off if you don\u2019t want the paused status shown in your chart. If you toggle on Omit zero values, you\u2019ll see all of the status options in your chart, even if there are no tasks for some of those status options.To configure your Y axis:With your chart view open, select \u2022\u2022\u2022 at the top of your database.Under Y axis, you can adjust the following:What to show: Choose the property that should be associated with your Y axis. You can also choose to show Count, which would show you the number of items associated with your X axis.Group by: Choose the property that you want to group your Y axis by. You can also choose None if you don\u2019t want any grouping.Omit zero values: Depending on your setup, you may or may not see this option. Toggle this on or off depending on whether you want to include property values for which there are no associated items. For example, let\u2019s say you have a status for paused tasks. If there aren\u2019t any tasks in your database that are paused, you can toggle Omit zero values off if you don\u2019t want the paused status shown in your chart. If you toggle on Omit zero values, you\u2019ll see all of the status options in your chart, even if there are no tasks for some of those status options.Cumulative: You\u2019ll see this option if your chart is showing Count or Sum and your X axis property is sorted in ascending order. Toggle on Cumulative if you want your chart to reflect the total amount of information gathered over time. Toggle off Cumulative if you want the chart to reflect the data for the current moment in time. For example, let\u2019s say you have a chart where you\u2019re tracking how many tasks you have completed. You completed two tasks yesterday, and three tasks today. If Cumulative is toggled on, you\u2019ll see two tasks completed yesterday, and five tasks (two from yesterday, three from today) completed today. If Cumulative is toggled off, you\u2019ll see two tasks completed yesterday, and three tasks completed today. Customize your donut chartNote: Your donut chart won\u2019t be able to show rollups, buttons, unique IDs, files and media, and certain formulas.

Before you select Invite in the steps above, you can hover over your guest\u2019s name or email for more information on how that person will be added to the page.If you\u2019re not able to share a page with a guest, this might be because: Your workspace has reached its guest limit.Your workspace or teamspace has prevented guests from being added to the page.The email domain of the guest you\u2019re trying to share the page with is not an allowed email domain for your workspace.

Permission levelsFor every person, group, or teamspace you share a page with, you can assign a different permission level. This helps to keep private information private and gives you granular, precise control over your work.Here are the different permission levels in Notion:Full access: People with full access to a page can edit any of the content it contains and share the page with anyone they want.Can edit: Select this level of access for people who should be able to edit the content on the page, but not share the page with others.Can edit content: This permission level is only found on database pages. People with this level of access can create and edit pages within the database, and edit property values for those pages. However, they will not be able to change the structure of the database and its properties, views, sorts, or filters. Learn more about databases here \u2192Can comment: Select this level of access for people who should only have the ability to comment on a page. They won\u2019t be able to edit or share the content.Can view: People with this level of access can read the content on the page, but they won\u2019t be able to comment, edit, or share.There are also different actions that people can take in a workspace depending on their role in the workspace. To learn more, read this article \u2192Edit permission levelsNote: If someone has requested a change in their permissions on a page you own, you\u2019ll be able to see, approve, and reject those requests from your Inbox.

Inherited permissionsWhen you create a subpage inside of a page, that subpage will take on the permissions of its parent page. To change this, go into a subpage and update the permissions there.Teamspace owners can set default permissions for content in their teamspace. This will apply to every new page created in the teamspace, and if you want to change them, you\u2019ll have to make changes at the page level.Permission overridesNotion respects the broadest level of access given to a user. For example, let's say you give Member A Can view permissions to a page. Then you give everyone in your workspace Full access, Member A will also get full access because they are member in your workspace.Additionally, moving a shared page to the Private section of your sidebar will remove everyone else's access on that page. Note: This override will only apply to the parent page \u2014 the permissions granted for any subpages will remain the same.If a page is set to be accessible to Anyone with link, note that even those that don\u2019t have the direct link may be able to access in certain cases including the following:The page is mentioned in or linked from another page shared more broadly.The page uses a two-way relation that links to another page shared more broadly.The page is nested inside another page that has been shared more broadly.See who's sharing a pageYou can tell who else has access to a page because their profile photos can be seen in the bar at the very top of the page.An avatar appears faded out if that person is not currently looking at the page.An avatar appears unfaded if the person is currently on the page.Hovering over an avatar will show you the person's name, email, and when they were last on the page.Clicking on an active avatar will jump you to the part of the page where they're reading or typing.When people are collaborating on the same page at the same time, you'll see their avatars move next to the blocks they are looking at or editing.Click \u2022\u2022\u2022 at the top right of any page and look at the bottom of the menu that pops up. You'll see who last edited the page and when.Request accessRequest access to a pageIf you open a page that you don\u2019t have access to, you can select No access on the page to send a request. This will notify the page\u2019s creators or editors, who can choose to accept or deny your access request.Request edit accessIf you have view or comment access to a page and want edit access:Open the page and select Share.In the Share tab, you\u2019ll see what level of permissions you currently have. Open the dropdown next to this information.Select Request edit access.This request will go to the page creator, who can accept or ignore it. You\u2019ll be notified once your request has been accepted \u2014 try refreshing the page if you\u2019re not able to edit it.Enterprise security settingsIf you\u2019re a workspace owner on an Enterprise Plan, you can control content sharing with additional security settings.

Learn moreNotion pricingBilling, payment, and refunds Who\u2019s who in a workspaceThere are several ways users can interact with a Notion workspace:Members:\u00a0People in your company or organization who can create and edit Notion pages, but can\u2019t change any settings. These are colleagues or people who you work with across a large portion of your workspace.Guests:\u00a0People external to your company or organization who can be invited to individual Notion pages, but not an entire workspace. These are people who aren\u2019t part of your team that you may want to work on specific pages with.Workspace owners: Admins who can manage workspace settings, delete a workspace, and manage other workspace owners, admins, members, and guests.Membership admins (Enterprise Plan only): People who can add or remove members from workspaces or groups. They don\u2019t have access to workspace settings. Note: Depending on how your workspace owner has adjusted your workspace\u2019s security settings, members may or may not by able to request adding guests or members. Additionally, users may or may not be able to request to be added to a workspace as a member. MembersMembers are individuals in your company or organization. These could be colleagues at the same organization or people who read, edit, and comment on a lot of the same pages in a workspace.To manage your workspace members, go to Settings \u2192 People or Members (depending on your plan). Here, you\u2019ll see:A list of active members of your workspace.What teamspaces and groups they belong to.Each member\u2019s role in the workspace.Add a memberNote: On paid plans, you'll be charged per member in your workspace.

Workspace owners can also remove other workspace owners from the workspace.Note:When you remove a member from a workspace, that person will instantly lose access to the workspace, and pages from the Private section of their left sidebar will be hidden from view. If you invite that member back to the workspace, their private pages will be unhidden.If a user has left and rejoined a workspace within the last 30 days, their private pages, shared pages, group membership, and teamspace membership will be restored upon rejoining the workspace. Allowed domains & auto-joiningIf you're using Notion at your company, you can make it easy for anyone to automatically join your workspace as a member when they sign in with their work email.Go to Settings \u2192 Settings.Under Allowed email domains, enter any email domain that you want to grant access to automatically, like your company's email domain. You can add multiple allowed domains in this field, but you'll only be able to add domains that workspace members' accounts are under.Now, whenever someone signs into Notion with an email that has one of those domains, they'll see the option to join your workspace during onboarding. If the user joins your workspace, they will become a member of your workspace and you will be billed accordingly.GuestsNote: Unlike members, guests are free to invite to your workspace as long as you stay within your plan\u2019s guest limit. If your workspace is above this limit, any new users that you share content with will be automatically added as members and not guests if they have the same organization email domain.To ensure you\u2019re adding users as guests and not members, you\u2019ll need to remove existing guests so you\u2019re below your limit, upgrade to a plan with a higher limit, or work with our sales team (for eligible customers). Guests are individuals external to your company or organization who you invite into your workspace on a page-by-page basis. For example, guests could be:People who have a different organization email domain.Contractors or interns who are working with you temporarily.Clients who you want to provide feedback on your work.Friends, family, or mentors that you want to have contribute to or review your work.Guests have the same capabilities as members, except:They can't be given workspace-wide access. They must be invited to individual pages in order to view them and their sub-pages.They can't create new pages outside of the ones they have access to.They can't be added to groups of members.They can't adjust workspace settings or billing information.They can't add new members to your workspace.They can't add new integrations to your workspace.Add a guestOn any page you want to share with a guest:Go to\u00a0Share\u00a0at the top right.Enter the email address of any guest you want to invite.Select a level of access for that guest from the dropdown and press\u00a0Invite.Select Skip for now to make sure you\u2019re adding them as a guest and not a member.They'll receive an email with a link to the page.If they don't already use Notion, they can sign up to access your page.Note:If you\u2019re on an Enterprise plan and the owner has prevented members from inviting guests to pages, then any people you invite to a page will automatically be added as members. Before you select Invite in the steps above, you can hover over your guest\u2019s name or email for more information on how that person will be added to the page.If you\u2019re not able to share a page with a guest, this might be because: Your workspace has reached its guest limit.Your workspace or teamspace has prevented guests from being added to the page.The email domain of the guest you\u2019re trying to share the page with is not an allowed email domain for your workspace. Allow and approve access requests from guestsTo make it easier for you to add guests to your workspace, Notion also allows people outside of your workspace to request access to certain pages in your workspace. This feature is available and turned on by default for all plans except Enterprise.If you\u2019re on a Personal Pro, Plus, or Business Plan, you can turn this setting off. Unfortunately, Free plans will not be able to turn this feature off. To do this:Open Settings \u2192 Security.Toggle off Allow page access requests from non-members.Once the guest submits a request to access a page, a notification will be sent to the inbox of the page\u2019s creator. The page creator can approve the request as well as adjust the level of access for that guest, or they can ignore the request.Note: When you add someone to a page, they can automatically access all of its sub-pages by default. That being said, you can restrict or expand sub-page permissions! Request adding guestsMembers of a workspace can request to add guests to it. This feature is available on Enterprise Plans only, and only workspace owners can enable or disable it.Enable guest requestsGo to Settings \u2192 Security.Make sure Disable members inviting guests to pages is turned on, then turn on Allow members to request adding guests. Workspace owners can Disable guests without removing existing guests from the workspace. They still have the option to remove all existing guests if desired.Once this is turned on, members will have to submit a request before they can invite a guest. Workspace owners are exempt and can continue to invite guests directly.Note: Allow members to request adding guests is a workspace level setting, and will override the any teamspace level guest setting. This means if a teamspace allows guests, but the workspace has enabled guest requests, members will have to submit guest invite requests to add guests to pages in the teamspace. Request to invite a guestIf you're a workspace owner, you can invite guests directly.If you're a member:Navigate to the page you want to invite a guest to. Just like with regular sharing, you must have full access permissions on the page to request to invite a guest.Select Share and type the name of the guest you want to invite.Select the role you want the guest to have.Select Invite.A notification will be sent to your workspace owner about your request, along with the page, role and email of the guest you requested. You will also receive confirmation that your workspace owner has been notified.Approve a guestGuest invite requests must be approved on a per page, per guest basis. Only workspace owners can view and approve guest requests. Each request will have the email of the guest, the member who requested it, the role that was requested, and the name of the page.A workspace owner can approve or reject a request to invite a guest directly from the notification they receive, or by going to by going to Settings \u2192 Members \u2192 Guests and finding the requests at the top. Once a workspace owner responds to a request, the member who submitted will be notified of the decision.Change guest access levelsOnce you've added a guest to a page, you can always change their level of access later. To change a guest's access level:Go to\u00a0Share\u00a0at the top right. You'll see the page's guests listed in the dropdown menu.Click the menu to the right of a guest's name.

If you were mentioned in a comment, you can reply directly from your Inbox by clicking\u00a0Reply.You can also resolve or re-open comments in this window. When you resolve a comment, it will disappear from the page it was made on. If you re-open a comment, it will reappear.RemindersWhen you add a reminder, Notion will send you a notification to draw your attention back to a particular task, event, or page at the time you specify. This is helpful for setting due dates and making sure you never forget a thing.Inline on a page, type @remind\u00a0followed by a time, date, or both, i.e.\u00a0@remind tomorrow,\u00a0@remind 7pm, or\u00a0@remind Wednesday at 1pm. This will create a blue tag. Clicking this tag opens up a calendar window where you can edit the date and time, change your timezone, and set exactly how you want to be reminded (i.e. 30 minutes beforehand).Inline reminders turn red when they change to @Today or are past due. In a database, add a\u00a0Date\u00a0property. When you click on that property (like on a cell in that column of a table), a calendar window opens where you can select when and how you want to be reminded. You can add a specific time of day as well.

To solve this issue, try the sync again with a different set of projects. You can also ensure that your projects don\u2019t have any issues in Jira.If your Jira token is no longer valid or someone has disconnected Jira from Notion, you\u2019ll see Sync stopped at the top of the database. To solve this issue, select Re-authenticate next to Sync stopped. You must be a workspace owner to complete this process.Once your Jira instance is reconnected with Notion, your projects and issues databases won\u2019t be recreated; instead, you\u2019ll continue to use the projects and issues databases you had before.Disconnect JiraIf you want to completely disconnect Jira from Notion:Go to Settings in your sidebar \u2192 Import.Select select \u2022\u2022\u2022 next to Jira \u2192 Remove.Legacy synced databasesLegacy synced databases look something like this.

            "In this ArticleLearn how you're billed for Notion, how you can set up and change payment, and how to request a refund \ud83d\udcb3Jump to FAQsContentsNotion billing basicsYou're billed per memberWe bill you upfrontEvery workspace is billed separatelyYour billing interval is set at the workspace levelYearly vs. monthly billingSee your plan and billing detailsChanging your billing intervalChange from monthly to yearlyChange from yearly to monthlyView your upcoming invoiceUnderstanding your invoicePayment methodsUpdate your payment method & billing informationSEPARefundsSeeing something unexpected in your invoice? See below for some common scenarios.Be mindful of who you add to your workspace and what kind of role they have. Visit this article and our pricing page to understand how we bill you depending on the users in your workspace and the plan you're on. Note: The billing policies described in this article may not apply to sales-assisted customers. Please reach out to your account team for more information. Notion billing basicsYou're billed per memberNotion uses a billing model that charges you based on the number of seats, or licenses, you are using in your workspace. One seat is assigned to each member (not guest) in your workspace. This billing model gives you the flexibility to change which specific people join your Notion workspace as a member, without accruing new charges every time you add a new user.Here\u2019s an example:Your team is working with three contractors, who have been added as members to your Notion instance. When their contracts are finished, you remove them from your Notion workspace.Until the end of your billing period (monthly or annual), you will still have three paid seats in Notion that you can instead fill with new contractors, new hires, interns, or anyone else who you might want to add to your workspace as a member.Learn more about workspace members and how to manage them here \u2192 When you add members to your workspace:Regardless of whether you're paying yearly or monthly, our system reviews how many members you've added and issues invoices on a monthly basis.You only pay for the fraction of the billing interval that a member belonged to your workspace.Because you pay at the beginning of every billing interval, these charges for changes made in the middle of a billing interval are added retroactively to your next invoice.On a monthly plan, this means you get your regular monthly invoice billing you for the month ahead (including new members), but the invoice will also include retroactive prorated charges for the members you added during your last billing interval. On a yearly plan, this means you'll receive an invoice at the next month mark (on the same calendar date you bought your plan) that will include two things:The amount due for each new member for the remainder of your year-long plan.Retroactive charges for those new members prorated based on the amount of time they've belonged to your workspace. When you remove members from your workspace:After removing members, you will still have access to any existing paid seats until the end of your billing interval. You can add new members to fill these seats at no additional charge.When your billing interval ends, we will recalculate the total number of paid seats in use in your workspace and bill you accordingly.  Go to Settings in your sidebar \u2192 People to view how many paid seats your workspace has, how many members are currently in your workspace, and when you'll be billed next. You can easily manage the members in your workspace here. We bill you upfrontYou always pay for Notion at the start of your billing interval. If you make changes in the middle of a billing interval, we'll prorate how much you're charged, so that you only pay for what you actually used. These prorations will be applied at the start of the next billing interval.Every workspace is billed separatelyYou can create multiple workspaces per account (in other words, per email address you signed up with), in which case you'd receive multiple bills. This is why you might see multiple charges for Notion even if you have only one account.If you have multiple workspaces, you'll be billed based on how many members you have in each (on a Plus, Business, or Enterprise Plan). Even if the same people are in multiple workspaces, you'll be charged for them in each one.Your billing interval is set at the workspace levelYou could have one workspace billed annually and one billed monthly. You pay less when you choose annual billing. Everyone who joins your workspace will add an additional charge based on the interval of that workspace.Yearly vs. monthly billingYou can choose to pay for Notion on a yearly or monthly basis. This impacts both how much you pay and when you pay.Yearly billing costs less.Your plan renews automatically either once a year or once a month. If you pay yearly, your plan will renew on the same calendar day you first purchased it for all following years.If you pay monthly, the same is true of each following month.For example, a yearly plan bought on May 3 will renew May 3 the next year, and a monthly plan renews June 3.Your bill adjusts for your paid seat count either once a year or once a month.If you pay yearly, the number of licenses you are paying for will be recalculated and reflected in your billing once a year, on the same calendar date as when you first purchased Notion.This is the only time during the year when your billing will change to reflect any paid seats that have been removed from your workspace.If you pay monthly, this recalculation will occur once a month on the same calendar date. Your billing will reflect any paid seats that have been removed from your workspace.When your plan renews, you will only be billed for the number of members currently in the workspace. This means your bill will go down if you have removed members since your last bill, and it will go up if you have added members since your last bill.If you expect your team size to fluctuate often, or you\u2019d like more control over your budget, we recommend a monthly billing interval. See your plan and billing detailsNote: Only workspace owners can view and manage plans and billing. To view the details of your plan and your billing information:Go to Settings in your sidebar.Click Billing in the sidebar of the pop-up window.At the top, you'll see which plan you're on, how much you're paying for it either yearly or monthly, and the date it will renew.Changing your billing intervalTo change your billing interval:Go to Settings in your sidebar.Click Billing in the sidebar of the window that pops up.Click Update next to your current billing interval and choose what you want.Change from monthly to yearlyWhen you change from monthly to yearly, you'll establish a new billing cycle, with your plan automatically renewing on the calendar day you made this change the next year.Whatever amount of time is left on your already paid monthly cycle will be subtracted from your annual payment.For example:Let's say you\u2019re on the Plus Plan, billed monthly.By April 15, you love Notion so much that you switch to a yearly billing interval.You already paid for part of the month, so we prorate the price of your yearly plan.Since half the month went by, we remove the unused time (the latter half of the month) from your yearly price.Change from yearly to monthlyWhen you change from yearly to monthly, the new monthly billing cycle will take effect the day your annual cycle ends. Your plan will automatically renew each month on the same calendar day going forward.View your upcoming invoiceTo view your upcoming invoice:Go to Settings in your sidebar.Select Billing.Under Invoices, select View invoice.Understanding your invoiceYour invoice might look different from what you expect, and this could be for several reasons:You've added or subtracted members from your workspace during the billing interval. Note that when you add new members to your yearly Plus, Business, or Enterprise Plan, you'll be charged for an entire year of Notion for each of them.You changed your billing interval from monthly to yearly, or vice versa.You upgraded your plan during a billing interval. In this case, we charge you your previous rate for the time you had that plan, and your new rate for the time you had your upgraded plan. It's a blend of both!You've applied credits to your balance due.Payment methodsOn Notion for web, you can pay for your plan with a debit or credit card, or Apple Pay. If you're in Europe, we also accept payment through SEPA direct debit (not credit transfer). You can also use Stripe Link to pay with a saved card or save your card for future use on any Stripe checkout. Notion uses\u00a0Stripe\u00a0to process payments.On an iOS device, you can pay with Apple Pay. Unfortunately, you can't make payments in the Android app at this time.If you pay with debit or credit card, you're charged upfront for the month or year you're about to spend on Notion. If you pay with SEPA direct debit, you\u2019ll receive a debit notification email. If you have been approved to pay via ACH or bank transfer, you'll receive an emailed invoice on the first day of your billing interval.Note: All valid billing credits will expire six months from the date they are generated. Once credits have expired, they can\u2019t be reinstated. Update your payment method & billing informationGo to Settings in your sidebar.Click Billing in the sidebar of the window that pops up.Click Edit method next to your payment method.Enter the information for your payment method.When you\u2019re done, click Update.SEPAIf you\u2019re using SEPA for the first time to pay for your Notion plan, note that payment must fully process before you can make any changes to your plan, add or remove AI, or update your payment method. We also won\u2019t be able to assist with refunds while your payment is processing.You can, however, add or remove members from your workspace during this time. These changes will be reflected in your next invoice.RefundsOur refund policy is simple.

            "In this ArticleNotion provides Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality for Business and Enterprise customers to access the app through a single authentication source. This allows IT administrators to better manage team access and keeps information more secure \ud83d\udd10Jump to FAQsContentsWhat is SAML SSO?Benefits of SSOSetting up SAML SSO for your workspacePrerequisites for SSO with NotionEnable SAML SSO for a single workspaceLink additional workspaces to an existing SAML SSO configurationEnforce SAML SSOJust-in-Time (JIT) ProvisioningIdentity Provider (IdP) SetupEntra IDGoogleOktaOneLoginRipplingCustom SAML SSO configurationSwitching identity providersTroubleshootingNotion\u2019s single sign-on (SSO) services are built upon the SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) 2.0 standard that permits identity managers to safely pass authorization credentials to service providers like Notion and connect your Identity Provider (IdP) and workspace(s) for an easier, more secure login experience.What is SAML SSO?SSO services permit a user to use one set of credentials (for example, a name or email address and password) to access multiple applications. The service authenticates the end user only once for all the applications the user has been given rights to and eliminates further prompts when the user switches applications during the same session.Note: SAML SSO is available for workspaces on Notion's Business or Enterprise Plans. Contact sales to learn more \u2192 Benefits of SSOStreamlines user management across systems for workspace owners.Removes the need for end-users to remember and manage multiple passwords. Simplifies end-users experience by allowing them to sign in at one single access point and enjoy a seamless experience across multiple applications.Note: Only members can access a workspace via SSO. Guests are not supported.Learn more about members and guests in a Notion workspace \u2192 Setting up SAML SSO for your workspacePrerequisites for SSO with NotionYour workspace must be on a Business Plan or Enterprise Plan.Your Identity Provider (IdP) must support the SAML 2.0 standard.Only a workspace owner can configure SAML SSO for a Notion workspace.At least one domain has been verified by a workspace owner.Enable SAML SSO for a single workspaceGo to Settings & members, then select the Settings tab.In the Allow email domains section, remove all email domains.Then select the Identity & provisioning tab. Verify one or more domains. See instructions for domain verification here \u2192 Toggle on Enable SAML SSO and the SAML SSO Configuration modal will automatically appear and prompt you to complete the set-up.The SAML SSO Configuration modal is divided into two parts:The Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL is to be entered in your Identity Provider (IdP) portalThe Identity Provider Details is a field in which either an IdP URL or IdP metadata XML must be provided to Notion.For more information on where to enter and obtain this information, please refer to our IdP-specific guides below. Note: Guests are not supported with SAML SSO on Notion. Link additional workspaces to an existing SAML SSO configurationNote: Linking additional workspaces to a SAML SSO configuration is only possible for customers on the Enterprise Plan. For more information, contact sales \u2192 From the workspace where you have verified your domain and enabled SAML SSO, there is a Linked workspaces section listing all of the workspaces associated with your SAML SSO configuration.  Users with a verified email address who have access to the primary workspace or one of the linked workspaces will be able to log in via SAML SSO.Sales-assisted Enterprise customers can add Enterprise workspaces to their SAML SSO configuration or remove them by reaching out to team@makenotion.com.Enforce SAML SSOOnce you have completed your configuration of SAML SSO for a single workspace, users will be able to log in via SAML SSO in addition to other log-in methods such as username/password and Google Authentication.To ensure users can only log in using SAML SSO and no other method, update the Login method to Only SAML SSO. Once this happens, workspace users will be logged out and required to log back in using SAML SSO. SAML SSO will only be enforced for users who use your verified domain and have access to the primary workspace or a linked workspace.Guests invited to pages in a Notion workspace can\u2019t use SAML SSO to login. Instead, they\u2019ll always use their e-mail and password or log in with Google or Apple.Workspace owners will always have the option to bypass SAML SSO by using their email and password credentials. This is to allow them to access Notion in the event of IdP/SAML failure. They will be able to log in and disable or update their configuration.Just-in-Time (JIT) ProvisioningNotion supports Just-in-Time provisioning when using SAML SSO. This allows someone signing in via SAML SSO to join the workspace automatically as a member.To enable Just-in-Time provisioning:In Settings & members \u2192 Identity & provisioning, make sure that Automatic account creation is enabled.Note: We don\u2019t recommend enabling Just-in Time provisioning if you are using SCIM. Having an \u201callowed email domain\u201d in place allows users on that domain to join the workspace so there could be a mismatch between membership in their Identity Providers and Notion. Identity Provider (IdP) SetupThese are instructions for setting up Notion SAML SSO with Entra ID (formerly Azure), Google, Okta, and OneLogin. If you use a different Identity Provider and need assistance with configuration, please contact our support team.Entra IDFor additional documentation, you can also reference steps on Entra ID's website here:Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) single sign-on (SSO) integration with NotionStep 1: Create a new application integrationSign in to the Entra ID portal.

If your IdP's metadata contains this element, extract the contained EntityDescriptor element and try again.FAQsWhy is the current Enable SAML SSO greyed out?The most common reason is that you have not yet verified ownership of a domain. If this is the case, you will notice that you either don\u2019t have any domains listed in the verify email domain section or the domain is pending verification. For next steps, refer to our instructions on how to complete domain verification here \u2192 Why can\u2019t I edit the SAML SSO settings?The most common reason is that you are trying to modify the verified domains or SSO configuration from a linked workspace which is a workspace that is already associated with another SSO configuration.In linked workspaces, all domain management and SSO configuration settings are read-only. To modify the SSO configuration or remove this workspace from the SSO configuration, you must have access to the primary workspace.

This unlocks domain management settings like configuring SAML SSO for your workspace, building Notion integrations using link previews, and controlling who can create workspaces (for Enterprise Plans only).Domain verification does not impact your billing.Verify a domain for your workspaceNote: To do this, you must be a workspace owner on a Business or Enterprise Plan. To verify a domain for your workspace:Go to Settings in your sidebar.Select Identity & provisioning.Next to Verified domains, select Add domain.Enter your new domain and select Next.Follow the prompts to update your DNS record.Click\u00a0Verify\u00a0to prompt Notion to check your DNS record.If your domain\u2019s status is Pending, select \u2022\u2022\u2022 next to the domain \u2192 View details \u2192 Verify to manually verify it.Once verification is complete, you\u2019ll receive a confirmation email and your domain\u2019s status will be Verified.Note:Typically, a change in the DNS record takes only minutes to propagate; however, there are cases where it may take up to 72 hours.You must verify a domain within one week of adding the domain. After a week, the verification code will expire and you\u2019ll have to repeat the steps above. Verify a domain for an integrationIf you\u2019re building an integration with Notion, like Link Previews, you\u2019ll need to verify your domain in the integration management page (this action will not take place in Notion).You can find the full instructions in our Developer Guides \u2192Workspace creation permissionsPrerequisites for customizing workspace creation permissionsWorkspace must be on the Enterprise Plan.You must be a workspace owner.You have verified at least one domain. Instructions for domain verification can be found above \u2192 Customize permissions for workspace creation using your domain(s)You can customize permissions for who can create new workspaces using your verified domain(s).In Settings & members, go to Identity & provisioning and then Workspace creation.Select Anyone to allow any user with your verified domain to create a new workspace.Select Workspace owners to prevent users with your verified domain from creating new workspaces.Note: The default setting for workspace creation permissions once a domain is verified is workspace owners only. Enabling Domain ClaimOnce a domain is verified, workspace owners on the Enterprise Plan can transfer, delete, or claim ownership over non-Enterprise workspaces created by users with their verified domain.Prerequisites for viewing claimable workspacesYou must be a workspace owner on the Enterprise Plan.Verified domain is a non-educational domain.What workspaces are eligible?Single-member workspaceThe workspace creator\u2019s email belongs to the verified corporate domain.Multi-member workspaceThe workspace creator\u2019s email belongs to the verified corporate domain (the creator does not need to be a current member of the space).At least one current workspace owner (either the creator or someone else) is using the verified corporate email address.Workspace is not on the Enterprise Plan.Notification periodOnce a workspace owner verifies a domain, an automated email will be sent to all workspace owners of workspaces created with that domain, notifying them that their workspaces are eligible to be claimed.During this 14 day notification period, workspace owners can only request ownership transfers on single-member workspaces. They will be unable to delete single-member workspaces or claim multi-member workspaces.After a domain is verified, users who create new workspaces with a verified domain will be notified upon creation that their workspace is eligible to be claimed.View claimable workspacesOnce a domain is verified, Enterprise workspace owners can view all non-enterprise workspaces created by users with their verified domain. This view can be found in your workspace security settings in the Identity & provisioning tab under the Domain management section. For each workspace, this view includes:Workspace namePlan typeNumber of membersWorkspace ownersCreated atCreated byWorkspace owners can take the following actions on their claimable workspaces:Request ownership change on single-member workspaces.Delete single-member workspaces.Claim multi-member workspaces.Export list of claimable workspacesWorkspace owners can also export the list of claimable workspaces as a CSV.Click on Settings & members in your sidebar and go to Identity & provisioning.Click on Browse workspaces and then Export to CSV in the top right.Change workspace ownershipWith domain management, workspace owners on the Enterprise Plan can request a change in ownership transfer on single-member workspaces using a verified domain to a non-corporate email address. This is especially helpful when users created a workspace using a corporate email address, but use the workspace primarily for personal projects.Workspace owners need to initiate the change request in the workspace security settings. In the workspace settings, navigate to the Identity & provisioning tab and Browse workspaces in the Domain management section. From the claimable workspace view, complete the following steps:Select the single-member workspace that you would like to change.In the \u2022\u2022\u2022 menu, select Require account change.Provide a contact email for questions from users about the request and confirm the action.In the view, the workspace will enter a Pending state.When the change request is submitted, an email notification will be sent to the workspace owner of the selected workspace and the user will not be able to access their workspace until they have completed the remaining transfer steps as follows:Log into the workspace.Follow the instructions and change email address associated with the account to a non-corporate email address. Note: While a single-member workspace ownership change is requested, the user cannot change the email associated with their user account.A verification code will be sent to the email address to confirm the user\u2019s ownership of the account. Enter this verification code in the workspace.An automated email will be sent once the change is complete.Prerequisites for changing a workspace ownershipYou must be a workspace owner on an Enterprise Plan.The workspace to be changed must be on a single-member.Delete workspacesWith domain management, Enterprise workspace owners can more easily govern how a verified domain is used and where related projects are stored on Notion. When an employee leaves a company, Enterprise workspace owners can delete their single member workspaces to cleanup old content while remaining compliant.Prerequisites for deleting a workspaceYou must be a workspace owner on the Enterprise Plan.The domain was verified at least 14 days ago.Workspace to be deleted must be a single-member workspace that is either free or not delinquent on payments.Note: Single-member workspaces that are deleted by an Enterprise workspace owner using domain management are not eligible for refunds or credits. In the workspace settings, navigate to the Identity & provisioning tab and select Browse workspaces in the Domain management section. From the claimable workspace view, complete the following steps:Select the single-member workspace you would like to deleteClick the \u2022\u2022\u2022 menu and select Delete workspaceProvide a contact email for questions from users about the deletion and confirm the actionIn the workspace view, a Recover button will appear next to the selected workspace. When the deletion is initiated, an email notification will be sent to the workspace owner of the selected workspace. The single member workspace owner will immediately lose access to their workspace.Note: Enterprise workspace owner will have 30 days to recover the workspace if needed. After 30 days, the workspace will be permanently deleted automatically. Workspace was deleted by mistake?If you receive an email notification about a workspace that has been deleted accidentally instead of transferred, please reach out to your respective Enterprise workspace owner provided in the email notification directly.Note: Only the Enterprise workspace owner who initiated the deletion can recover deleted workspaces. Notion Support cannot override Enterprise workspace owner actions to restore deleted workspaces.  Recover workspacesTo recover a deleted workspace, the Enterprise workspace owner that initiated the deletion can do this in the workspace settings: navigate to the Identity & provisioning tab and select Browse workspaces in the Domain management section. From the claimable workspace view, complete the following steps:Go to the single-member workspace you would like to recover.Click on the Recover button for the workspace and confirm.In the view the workspace will now appear without the recover button.The owner of the single-member workspace will regain access to their workspace and their workspace content will be restored.The workspace owner of the single-member workspace selected for deletion can request Notion Support extend the recovery timeframe by 30 days from the day they contact Support.

You have the flexibility to select the installation path for Notion and manage update settings. By default, the Notion app is set up in the /Applications folder on your employees\u2019 machines and is configured to update automatically with each new release.Note: Regular updates are crucial for access to the latest features and ensuring the highest level of security, especially if automatic updates are turned off. Installing Notion on shared machinesNotion allows for use on shared machines by multiple users. It can be installed in either the /Applications or ~/Applications folder of a user's machine. The best installation method depends on your organization's specific needs./ApplicationsAll users on the machine use the same installation of Notion.Updates made to Notion apply to all users on the machine.Users must be administrators to update Notion.~/ApplicationsEach user on a shared machine has their own installation of Notion.Updates made to one instance of Notion do not affect other instances of Notion for other users on the same machine.Users do not need to be administrators to update Notion.Distribute NotionAfter deciding on the installation method, download the appropriate Notion desktop app build. There are three builds available: Intel (x64), Apple Silicon (arm64), and Universal (x64 or arm64). Ensure you distribute the correct build to match your employees' machine types.Note: The Universal build works on Intel and Apple Silicon machines. Keep in mind the installation file is much larger than the other builds. Disable automatic updatesNotion allows you to disable automatic updates for individual users. This feature is useful for when you want to test new Notion app versions before a widespread rollout, or if you prefer to stagger the update process. To keep the app working smoothly and securely, we advise updating Notion with each new version release.To prevent Notion from automatically checking for updates, run the following terminal command as each user who will be running Notion:defaults write notion.id NotionNoAutoUpdates -bool YESUse the following command to re-enable automatic updates:defaults write notion.id NotionNoAutoUpdates -bool NOAllow users to update NotionIf Notion is installed in the ~/Applications folder, users can update the app independently without needing special permissions. However, if the app is installed in the /Applications folder, update permissions are required. Users must be machine administrators and have write access to /Applications, notion.app, and all its subfiles.For shared machines, we recommend setting up a permissions group for all Notion users and installing Notion in a subfolder of /Applications. You can grant this group ownership and write access to the subfolder using the terminal command below. Make sure you replace group with your permissions group name and subfolder with your subfolder name:chown -R :group /Applications/subfolder && chmod -R 775 /Applications/subfolder",

As soon as they sign up, Notion will recognize their email and ask if they want to join your workspace. New allowed domains are restricted to the email domains of the members of that workspace. To add a domain that isn't available, someone with an email address from that domain will have to join the workspace.Use this so all new employees who join your company can easily join your shared workspace.

Workspace admins on the Enterprise Plan can give themselves and others access to specific pages using content search, so that those pages can be included in future exports. Some content also may not be exported based on teamspace settings.A sitemap (index.html) is included the export to help you navigate the exported workspace.

            "In this ArticleLearn about how to make your Notion workspace HIPAA compliant, and how to enable HIPAA compliance \ud83c\udfe5Jump to FAQsContentsConfiguring Notion for HIPAAEnable HIPAA complianceDeactivate HIPAA complianceThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a US federal law that was enacted in 1996 that requires the protection and confidential handling of protected health information (PHI) by covered entities such as healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates. This article provides users required product configurations to make their Notion workspace HIPAA compliant.Note: Notion's Business Associate Agreement (BAA) governs the protection of Personal Health Information (PHI) that is stored in the Notion Service. To be eligible to sign Notion\u2019s BAA, you must subscribe to our Enterprise Plan.Notion Calendar, any Notion Calendar features, and any Beta Services are not covered by the BAA and therefore may not be used or deployed in a manner that processes protected health information.To the extent that any language on this page and language found in the BAA conflict at any time, the BAA shall control. Configuring Notion for HIPAAHIPAA Technical Safeguard RequirementsNotion's Supporting ConfigurationsAccess ControlImplement technical policies and procedures for electronic information systems that maintain electronic protected health information to allow access only to those persons or software programs that have been granted access rights.Notion\u2019s SAML SSO is built upon the SAML 2.0 standard, connecting your Identity Provider (IdP) and workspace(s) for an easier, more secure login experience. Notion supports official configurations for SAML SSO with: Azure, Google, Gusto, Okta, OneLogin, and Rippling.To get started using SAML SSO with Notion, you'll need to complete the following steps:Verify domain(s): To use advanced security features, you must verify ownership of your email domain. This is an automated process that involves adding a TXT record onto your domain\u2019s DNS to verify your ownership of it.Enable SAML SSO: This will toggle the feature on and complete the configuration. For more information on completing the SAML SSO configuration, please refer to this article.Change default login method: Once SAML SSO is enabled for the first time, the default login method will be set to\u00a0Any method, meaning that users have the option of logging in via SAML or their normal login method. By setting this to Only SAML SSO, this enforces SAML as the login method for your workspace for managed users with verified company emails.Link additional workspaces: If you have more than one workspace you\u2019d like to configure with SSO, you can do so by reaching out to\u00a0team@makenotion.com.Once properly configured, any members signing into your workspace(s) will need to use the verified domain and will need to be authenticated through your identity provider. Enterprise workspace owners are able to bypass by using an alternative login method in case there\u2019s an IdP/SAML SSO failure.Unique User IdentificationAssign a unique name and/or number for identifying and tracking user identity.Notion has a SCIM API which can be used to provision, manage, and de-provision members and groups. Workspace owners can find the required API key by going to Settings \u2192 Security & identity \u2192 SCIM Configuration and clicking to view the token.Please see our SCIM documentation for the latest information on how you can interact with Notion\u2019s SCIM API. Notion supports official SCIM applications with Google, Gusto, Okta, OneLogin, and Rippling.Emergency Access ProcedureEstablish (and implement as needed) procedures for obtaining necessary electronic protected health information during an emergency.Content search provides Enterprise workspace owners with visibility into workspace content to improve governance of the workspace and resolve page access issues. Content search allows you to:\u2022 View who has access to a page\u2022 Modify the permissions of a page\u2022 Discover and re-assign abandoned pages from former employeesYou can export a Notion page, database, or entire workspace at any time.Automatic LogoffImplement electronic procedures that terminate an electronic session after a predetermined time of inactivity.Set custom session duration: For managed users on the Enterprise Plan, Notion has a default session duration of 180 days. However, workspace owners can customize their session duration from 1 hour to 180 days.Force logout managed users: Force logout for individual users or for all workspace users at once. Force password reset: Force password reset for individual users or for all workspace users at once.If you de-provision a user via SCIM, they will be removed from the workspace and their session will be terminated.Audit ControlsImplement hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that record and examine activity in information systems that contain or use electronic protected health information.Enterprise workspace owners have access to an Audit Log via\u00a0Settings. This gives an overview of a large range of events that have occurred in the workspace.This can be especially helpful for identifying potential security issues, investigating suspicious behavior, and troubleshooting access. The workspace audit log can be exported in CSV format.Enterprise customers can also utilize our Data Loss Prevention (DLP) partner integrations to discover, classify, and protect sensitive data in Notion.Integrity ControlsImplement policies and procedures to protect electronic protected health information from improper alteration or destruction.Implement electronic mechanisms to corroborate that electronic protected health information has not been altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.Implement security measures to ensure that electronically transmitted electronic protected health information is not improperly modified without detection until disposed of.Disable public page sharing: This will disable the Share to web option in the Share menu on every page in this workspace.Disable guests: This prevents anyone from inviting people outside the workspace to any page. You don\u2019t need to use this control if you\u2019d like to invite guests as needed, but note that Notion may not be used to communicate with patients, plan members, or their families and employers. If you need to enable guests, we recommend turning on guest requests. This implements an approval process so that you can have guests in your workspace while ensuring HIPAA compliance.Disable moving or duplicating pages to other workspaces: This prevents anyone from moving or duplicating pages to other workspaces via the Move To or Duplicate action.Disable export: This prevents anyone from exporting as Markdown, CSV, or PDF.Disable workspace creation: This prevents anyone from creating new workspace(s) without approval.Disable or allowlist third party extensions: This prevents anyone from adding non-approved 3rd party extensions to your Notion workspace.Disable external workspace access: This prevents managed users from joining or accessing external workspace outside of your organization.Person or Entity AuthenticationImplement procedures to verify that a person or entity seeking access to electronic protected health information is the one claimed.Disable profile changes: This prevents managed users from changing their own profile information to avoid impersonations.Domain management: Domain refers to the email address domain associated with a Notion account. Domain verification allows workspace owners to claim ownership over a domain, which will unlock domain management settings.Disable guests: This prevents anyone from inviting people outside the workspace to any page. You don\u2019t need to use this control if you\u2019d like to invite guests as needed, but note that Notion may not be used to communicate with patients, plan members, or their families and employers. If you need to enable guests, we recommend turning on guest requests. This implements an approval process so that you can have guests in your workspace while ensuring HIPAA compliance.Suspend or delete a managed user account: Suspend or delete managed user accounts from the user management dashboard.Disable managed user account deletion: Prevent managed users from deleting their accounts on their own.Data Retention & DisposalImplement policies and procedures to address the final disposition of electronic PHI and/or the hardware or electronic media on which it is stored.Custom data retention settings allow Enterprise workspace owners to have control over when users\u2019 pages are deleted from Trash, and how long they can be retained for afterwards.We keep backups of our database, which allows us to restore a snapshot of your content in the past 30 days if you need it.Transmission SecurityImplement technical security measures to guard against unauthorizedaccess to electronic protected health information that is being transmitted over an electronic communications network.Implement a mechanism to encrypt electronic protected health information whenever deemed appropriate.Encryption at rest: Customer data is encrypted at rest using AES-256. Customer data is encrypted when on Notion\u2019s internal networks, at rest in Cloud storage, database tables, and backups.Encryption in transit: Data sent in-transit is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or greater.Note: Enterprise workspace owners are able to bypass by using an alternative login method in case there\u2019s an IdP/SAML SSO failure.

This page highlights some of the key aspects of our program.How we handle your dataAt Notion, our team is dedicated to developing and implementing data privacy processes and safeguards that meet industry standards and best practices. We conduct ongoing training for our teams to ensure that they are up to speed with developments in legislation and essential privacy and security practices. Every Notion employee and contractor signs up to non-disclosure terms to maintain the confidentiality and security of your data. Notion also holds any vendors that handle personal data to the same data management, security, and privacy practices and standards to which we hold ourselves.What is Customer Data?Notion defines Customer Data as any data that a customer stores in the Notion services. This can include personal information. Customer data does not include analytics data or Account Information, which we describe below. The terms of the Notion MSA and Notion DPA apply to your Customer Data.What is Account Information?Account information is the information that our customers provide to us so that we can create and administer their customer accounts. For example, account information includes names, usernames, passwords, phone numbers, email addresses, Workspace metadata, support communications, billing information, and usage information associated with your Notion account. The terms of the Notion Privacy Policy apply to any personal information included in Account Information.Who owns and controls Customer Data?You own your Customer Data, including any content you submit or upload to the Notion Service.You control your Customer Data. You determine what content and data will be uploaded to  Notion. Once Customer Data is uploaded you manage access to your workspace by allocating user logins to individuals. You also control the administration of the Customer Data by managing you groups, permissions and the user credentials that are under your control.How does Notion use my Account Information?The Notion Privacy Policy describes in detail how Notion collects and uses your account information.Who should I contact if I have any questions about Notion\u2019s data protection practices?If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please contact us at:Notion Labs, Inc. 2300 Harrison Street San Francisco, CA 94110 United States privacy@makenotion.comGDPRThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data protection law that governs the collection of and use of personal data of EU residents, and that allows data subjects to exercise control over their data. As the GDPR is widely considered to be the most stringent global privacy standard, we have mapped our privacy program to the GDPR and other global privacy regulations.Notion as Processor and ControllerThe GDPR and other data protection legislation have two primary classifications related to the collection and processing of personal data: data controller and data processor.A data controller determines the means and purposes for processing personal data, while a data processor is a party that processes data on behalf of the data controller.Where our customer is a data controller or data processor, Notion is the data processor of personal data that our customer and their users upload to the Notion service. We process any such personal data at our customer\u2019s direction and on our customer\u2019s behalf. We conduct this processing in accordance with Notion\u2019s Data Processing Addendum.Cross Border Transfers - Standard Contractual ClausesWe understand and adhere to the rules for international transfers of personal data outside of the European Economic Area and UK. In order for our customers to be confident of Notion\u2019s data transfer processes our Data Processing Addendum incorporates both the EU and UK Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs). In response to the Schrems II ruling, our DPA lists the technical and organisational measures we employ to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place when we transfer personal data to countries outside of the EEA and UK.\u00a0 For more information about our technical security measures, please see our\u00a0security page.Transfer Impact AssessmentNotion understands and appreciates the importance of maintaining transfer impact assessments (TIA) as a supplementary measure and as a critical piece of your privacy compliance program. To assist our customers in completing these assessments, we maintain Transfer Impact Assessment page that includes all of the information about Notion that you need to complete your TIA.Subprocessor ListWe work with certain companies and tool systems to provide our services to you. All of these companies have been carefully vetted for best-in-class security and data privacy practices. For more information, please see our\u00a0list of subprocessors.Data GovernanceData governance relates to the policies and procedures that dictate how data is procured and used throughout its life cycle. From creation and collection to processing, distribution, storage and deletion. Notion\u2019s commitment to data governance is key to keeping our users data secure, private, accurate, and accessible.Privacy by DesignAt Notion, we believe in privacy by design, which means that privacy considerations are built into every aspect of our products and services from the outset. This includes the development of new products, features, and the selection of vendors.Notion conducts regular training with our personnel to reinforce the concept that Notion needs to think of user privacy at all stages of the development lifecycle.Data ExportCompanies generally have a duty to back up their information in multiple places. To help with this Notion offers the option to save any Notion page, database, and non-database page to your computer in various formats. This way our customers can further protect themselves by backing up their information at any time.Data ImportNotion\u2019s data import function\u00a0lets you upload information from external sources and combine it with the data already held in your workspace. Like most people, you probably have data, documents, and notes scattered across many files and apps. You can centralize your information in one place by moving it all into Notion.Data DeletionThe workspace owner controls the workspace\u2019s Customer Data. This includes all of the content submitted by customers and their users. When users leave a workspace, they may have the right to request that their data is deleted by the workspace owner. When customers terminate their subscription they also have the right to request that their data be deleted by Notion.Notion allows for Account Deletion and Workspace Deletion.When you delete an account, Notion will:Delete the account associated with that email addressDelete any\u00a0private workspace(s) in which you are the\u00a0only memberDelete any\u00a0shared workspace(s) in which you are the\u00a0only adminRemove you from any shared workspace(s) in which you are a member or one of multiple adminsTo delete a workspace, you must be a workspace owner of that workspace. When you delete a workspace, Notion will:Delete all content in that workspaceReturn you to another workspace you belong to, or the sign up page for Notion if you don't belong to any othersTo learn more about how to delete your Notion account please see our Delete Your Account page. If you are a Customer and would like to terminate your contract, please see our MSA.Data AccessNotion provides an advanced set of access functionality to help customers effectively protect their information. Notion also uses encryption to protect Customer Data from outside access.To learn more about how data access works at Notion please see our Data Access Consent page.Data BackupAll Customer Data is stored in the cloud, and we keep\u00a0per-minute backups\u00a0of your page content on our server. That said, your data belongs to you, so we've made it easy to create your own backups and keep your information portable. To learn more about this please see Notion\u2019s Back up your Data page.AgreementsAt Notion we strive to keep all of our agreements up to date with the latest regulations and industry standards.

To ensure that our terms track with the GDPR, CCPA and other global privacy standards we continually have our terms assessed by leading privacy experts in multiple jurisdictions.PoliciesAt Notion we want to be as transparent as possible with our customers about how we collect, process, store, and use their personal data.

How can I disconnect my Google Drive Workspace from my Notion workspace?You can edit your connection by opening Notion AI at the bottom of your screen and clicking on \u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2192 Connect Google Drive \u2192 Settings.How do the permission settings work?All permissions in a Google document will be respected for individual users and general access types listed below:Restricted: Only users who have been directly added to the document will have access{Company Name}: Anyone in the company can access the document as long as any user in the workspace has visited the page. In the document, the access level should be set to Can find in search results and not Must have link to access, which is the default setting. Anyone with link: Anyone in the company can access the document if they have visited the document at least once.Note: Target audiences are not supported (for example, 20 individual users added to a target audience named Sales team). How long does it take for the integration to complete?Upon initial connection, it will take the integration approximately 36 hours to sync. Once the integration syncs, you can expect real-time updates to your Google Drive to be reflected in Notion AI on an ongoing basis.How long does it take for new content to appear?New content added to Google documents will update every hour and will be available in searches then in Notion AI.Will all future content or shared/user drives be available?Yes. Anytime your organization sets up up a new shared or user-level drive, it will be synced to Notion AI. You can edit this option in your settings.Can I edit the connection after set up?You can edit your connection by opening Notion AI at the bottom of your screen and clicking on \u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2192 Connect Google Drive \u2192 Settings.Can I add connect multiple Notion workspaces to my Google Workspace?Not at this time. The workspace admin will only be able to connect one Notion workspace to one Google Workspace.Does Notion AI respect Google Drive permissions?Absolutely. Notion AI will honor existing permissions according to our existing Notion AI Security Practices. Users will not be able to generate content or receive responses based on resources they do not have access to. Specific to third party content, Notion AI is handling both private and public content with security in mind, only ingesting content according to the permissions mapping between what Google Drive and Notion users.How do shared drives work?If a shared drive lives outside your Google Workspace, Notion AI will not be able to access or retrieve the information in it.If a shared drive is in your connected Google Workspace, we will respect the permission settings of the Drive (if the shared drive was directly shared with you) or the file  (the file has been shared directly with you or with a group that you are a part of).How does Notion store or reference my Google Drive data in its systems?Similar to our core Notion AI product, we store create and store embeddings in a vector database hosted by Pinecone, which powers the ability to provide responses to questions that leverage third party content (like in Google Drive). Pinecone has been vetted by our security team as well as an external auditor to obtain their SOC2 Type II certification. Learn more about Pinecone\u2019s security here \u2192Which account should I use to initiate the connection for Google Drive in Notion?Whichever account is used to initiate connection will be stored in the Notion system as a customer admin email, and we will use this admin email for future updates, so it's important for customers to provide an email that won't change in terms of permissions or active status so that service isn't impacted when, for example, an admin leaves the company. You can use any service email that has admin privileges to your Google Workspace and will remain the same, like admin-svc@company.com.Learn moreNotion AI connectors betaNotion AI connectors for SlackWhat is Notion AI?",

Notion AI has the capabilities of multiple AI tools, all in one place. Use it to:Get answers from your Notion workspace and connected appsGenerate docs and edit your writingAnalyze PDFs and imagesChat about anything, using AI knowledge from models like GPT-4 and ClaudeAutofill summaries and insights across entire databasesNotion AI appears seamlessly in your workspace but leverages technology from several AI Subprocessors to provide you with the service. Check out our Subprocessor Page for a complete list of our current Subprocessors, and learn more about Notion AI here \u2192How does Notion AI work?Who are Notion\u2019s Large Language Model Providers?Notion currently utilizes various large language models (LLMs) hosted by Notion as well as by organizations such as Anthropic and OpenAI. We continuously evaluate LLM providers and their models to provide the highest quality experience to our Notion AI users. Any third parties that process Customer Data will be published in our Subprocessor Page.How do I subscribe to new Subprocessor notifications?Customers may sign up to receive notification of new Subprocessors by emailing team@makenotion.com with the subject \u201cSubscribe to New Subprocessors.\u201d Once a customer has signed up to receive new Subprocessor notifications, Notion will provide that customer with notice of any new Subprocessors before authorizing the new Subprocessor to process Customer Data. For additional information, please see our Data Processing Addendum.How does Notion AI use content from a workspace?Notion AI is able to reference content from your workspace through two key phases:Generating an embedding (i.e., a semantic representation of the information stored in your workspace).Generating responses informed by the content in your workspace.What are embeddings?Embeddings are numerical representations of text or documents. These representations capture the meaning and context of the text in a multidimensional space, where similar topics have similar numerical representations. By using embeddings, vector search algorithms can efficiently compare and find similarities between different pieces of text or documents. For Notion AI, embeddings are created from workspace content to enable the system to provide accurate and relevant responses to user questions.Here is an example of an embedding from OpenAI:[  -0.02541878,  -0.0104167685,  -0.0015037002,  ...,  -0.004155378,  -0.00043069973,  -0.01679479]How are embeddings created?For each page in your workspace, we generate an embedding by using an OpenAI zero-retention embeddings API.Notion receives an embedding for each Notion page and stores it in a vector database (e.g., Pinecone). The vector database is a data store optimized for embeddings that enables fast lookup of the most relevant pages given a user request. How are embeddings protected?Despite embeddings only being a numerical representation of Customer Data, Notion still treats embeddings with the same level of security and privacy considerations as Customer Data. All our Customer Data commitments outlined in our Master Service Agreement (MSA) and Data Processing Agreement (DPA) apply to embeddings. View our Terms and Privacy Page for more information.We store embeddings with vector databases like Pinecone. These vector databases have been vetted by our security team as well as an external auditor to obtain their SOC 2 Type 2 certification.How are responses generated?Notion receives a request from a user.The request is passed to LLMs and AI Models. If the request does not require searching the Notion workspace, a response is generated at this point and returned. If the user\u2019s request requires searching their workspace, LLMs and AI Models generate a search query most relevant for the user request.The query is passed to a vector database, where a list of pages is found based on relevance to that query.Notion sends the query \u2014 and the pages identified by the vector database \u2014 to LLMs and AI Models where the pages are refined and ranked by relevance to the query.The query, refined list of pages, and ranking of pages are processed by the LLMs and AI Models to generate a response that fulfills the user\u2019s request.Notion processes the output to adhere to the right format and language and displays the output to the user. How is my data protected?Does Notion AI respect existing permissions?Yes, Notion AI honors existing permissions. The LLMs and AI Models used to generate AI responses for a user cannot see or use any information to which that user does not already have access.How is Customer Data protected when sent to AI Subprocessors?Notion AI is designed to protect your Customer Data and prevent information leaks to other users of the service.Prior to engaging any third-party Subprocessor or vendor, Notion evaluates their privacy, security, and confidentiality practices, and executes an agreement implementing its applicable security, privacy, and legal obligations. All Subprocessors are monitored and reviewed at least annually to ensure continued compliance with Notion\u2019s security and privacy expectations. This includes reviewing documents such as attestation reports, penetration tests, and other artifacts based on the Subprocessor\u2019s criticality and other risk factors. As part of the onboarding and ongoing reviews, technology security questionnaires are distributed to vendors and are required to be completed. Significant public security events are also assessed to protect the supply chain attack surface.When we send your Customer Data to third parties, it is encrypted in-transit using TLS 1.2 or greater.For more information about how Notion processes your data, please refer to our Data Processing Addendum.Will my data be used to train any models?By default, Notion and its AI Subprocessors do not use Customer Data to train any models. We specifically have contractual agreements in place with our AI Subprocessors that prohibit the use of Customer Data to train their models.Your use of Notion AI does not grant Notion any right or license to your Customer Data to train our machine learning models.How is Customer Data segregated?Individual customer accounts are kept separate in our production environment. We do not mix or process data from different customers together during AI processing. This means we do not expose your data to other Notion customers.What are the data retention obligations of third-party AI providers?Notion AI Subprocessors have data retention policies that allow Notion to meet our obligations to customers for the processing of data.When using Notion AI, our LLM providers utilize zero data retention for Enterprise plan workspaces, so no data is stored with LLM providers. For all non-Enterprise plan workspaces, LLM providers only retain Customer Data for 30 days or fewer before deletion. Notion AI is additionally powered by OpenAI's embeddings. OpenAI does not retain any Customer Data through their embeddings service.Embeddings stored in vector databases are deleted within 60 days from when the page or workspace is deleted.If a user deletes a Notion page or Notion workspace, we can restore the content within 30 days. After 30 days, the data is deleted and unrecoverable. This includes any AI-generated data and embeddings. For more information about deleting or restoring your data, please refer to this article.What compliance standards does Notion AI meet?Notion AI is included in the scope of Notion\u2019s SOC 2 Type 2 report and ISO 27001 certification, demonstrating our commitment to various regulatory and industry standards.Notion AI enables HIPAA compliance by utilizing LLM provider\u2019s zero-retention APIs and allows for the processing of protected health information (PHI).What controls can be added?Can data loss prevention (DLP) be configured to alert for data being used by Notion AI?Customers can trigger data loss prevention (DLP) alerts for sensitive content in their Notion workspace using third-party integration partners on our Enterprise Plan. That will include content in an AI prompt and the content generated by AI. Learn more about our DLP integrations here.What are the legal considerations?Are there rules against what I can do with Notion AI?The Notion AI Supplementary Terms apply to your usage of Notion AI. In addition, Notion\u2019s Content & Use Policy applies to any content on Notion, including content generated by Notion AI. Violating these terms can result in removal of your content or suspension of access to your workspace.Who owns the rights to content generated by Notion AI?Notion does not claim ownership of your input or the generated output. This is addressed in the Notion AI Supplementary Terms in the \"Input and Output\" section:You may provide input to be processed by Notion AI (\u201cInput\u201d), and receive output generated and returned by Notion AI based on the Input (\u201cOutput\u201d). When you use Notion AI, Input and Output are your Customer Data.You can also reference our standard data protection practices.",

BlockingHave a doctor\u2019s appointment that you don\u2019t want a teammate to schedule over? Notion Calendar\u2019s blocking features make it easy to block events across your various calendars. For example, Notion Calendar can put a block on your work calendar for an event you have on your personal calendar, so people know you\u2019re busy without being able to see your personal commitments. You can block single events or auto-block whole calendars.Block an event or an entire calendarOn desktop or web:Right-click an event and select Block on calendar.Select the calendar you want to create a block in.To create a block for a single event, select This event. Alternatively, you can select All events from {calendar name} to set up auto-blocking. For example, if you are creating a block on your work calendar for an event on your personal calendar, you can synchronize the two calendars so that all future events from your personal calendar will be blocked on your work calendar.Choose to Include details from the original calendar event in the block, or simply Show as busy. This will apply to future blocks if you choose to auto-block.If you manage your time across two calendars, like work and personal, use event blocking to automatically block time on each. To see what details you\u2019ve shared on a calendar block, right-click the original event and select Block on calendar. There will be a \ud83d\udd12\u00a0next to the calendar where the block was set up \u2014 if the lock is open, that means the event\u2019s details have been shared. If the lock is closed, that means the event\u2019s details are hidden.Alternatively, you can hide the original calendar from view by selecting the eye icon next to its name in the left sidebar. Then, you can find the block on your other calendar and see its details. Remove blockingYou can remove blocks the same way you created them. Right-click a blocked event and unselect the calendar where the block lives. You can unblock a single event, or turn off auto-blocking by unblocking all events.You may want to undo auto-blocking for a calendar that you no longer have access to.

            "In this ArticleNotion Calendar works with a lot of other tools that you already use in your day to day. It also works seamlessly with Notion \ud83d\udd0cContentsConferencing integrationsSet a default conferencing optionZoomGoogle MeetNotion integrationNotion Calendar APIDid you know you can use Notion Calendar with Notion? Learn more here \u2192 Conferencing integrationsFor the best experience with setting up conferencing integrations and adding conferencing links to events, use Notion Calendar on desktop or web. Notion Calendar integrates with conferencing tools like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and many more. There are three types of conferencing integrations in Notion Calendar:Default integrations: Conferencing that is available to you by default from your calendar provider. Google Meet, which is linked to Google Calendar, is one example.Connected integrations: An integration you can set up by logging into a conferencing tool. New events you create on desktop or web will generate new links for this conference tool from within Notion Calendar. Zoom is an example of a connected integration that Notion Calendar supports.Custom integrations: You can add a stable conferencing link for a conferencing tool of your choice by going to Settings \u2192 Conferencing \u2192 Conferencing providers \u2192 Add. You can give your integration a name. This conferencing tool will show up in the conferencing dropdown when you create events. Any stable links will work, but Notion Calendar can detect popular services, including Around, BlueJeans, Doxy.me, Microsoft Teams, Skype, Webex, and Whereby.Note: If an event contains conferencing links in both its description and conferencing field, you\u2019ll be taken to the link from the event\u2019s description when you join a meeting from Notion Calendar. Set a default conferencing optionA default conferencing option allows you to automatically add conferencing to an event that has at least one other participant when you\u2019re using Notion Calendar on desktop. To set Zoom as this default option, go to Settings \u2192 Conferencing \u2192 Default conferencing, then in the dropdown, select Zoom.ZoomConnect your Zoom accountTo connect your Zoom and Notion Calendar accounts, go to Settings \u2192 Conferencing. Find Zoom and select Configure. When you\u2019re redirected to your browser, make sure you\u2019re logged in with the right Zoom account, then select Authorize to give Notion Calendar access.Notion Calendar asks only for the Zoom permissions that we absolutely need to make sure the integration with Notion Calendar works properly. These permissions are only used to allow you to connect your account and add Zoom meetings to events. Learn more about our security practices here \u2192Passcode settingsIf you\u2019ve enabled the use of Personal Meeting IDs (PMIs) in your Zoom Profile Settings, Notion Calendar will use your configured stable PMI and passcode when adding a Zoom link to a meeting. If this setting is off in Zoom, Notion Calendar will protect your Zoom calls with a secure, one-time PIN and include it in the meeting for you and participants to join with a single click. Notion Calendar generates these PINs according to your Zoom admin's passcode complexity requirements.Disconnect your Zoom accountTo stop using your Zoom account with Notion Calendar, go to Settings \u2192 Conferencing. Find Zoom and select Disconnect.If you remove Notion Calendar from your installed apps in Zoom App Marketplace, we will follow Zoom's deauthorization and data compliance guidelines.Note:If you\u2019re having trouble authorizing Notion Calendar as you set up the integration, have an admin sign into marketplace.zoom.us, search for Notion Calendar, and turn on Pre-approve.Currently, when you join a meeting in the Zoom app from Notion Calendar, your video will be turned off by default.If you have any problems joining a meeting, try disconnecting then reconnecting your Zoom account. Google MeetBecause Notion Calendar is already connected to your Google account, you don\u2019t need to do anything else to add Google Meet links to your meetings! Even if you\u2019ve connected multiple Google accounts to Notion Calendar, Notion Calendar will make sure you\u2019re joining meetings across your various calendars from the right Google account.Note: If you don\u2019t see Google Meet as a conferencing option in Notion Calendar, it might mean your Google Workspace doesn\u2019t have Google Meet enabled. Reach out to an admin to turn on Meet video calling. Notion integrationNotion Calendar can be used with Notion.

Databases can be used for anything \u2014 a collection of meeting notes, your core database of projects and tasks, a document storage system, and so much more. Information in your databases can be viewed in multiple ways, from a list to a calendar to kanban board.Document collaboration \u2014 Not only can you collaborate on tasks, but you can also work together on documents and notes. It\u2019s great for brainstorming, meeting minutes, proposals and briefs, and collaborative writing.Nested pages \u2014 Notion allows you to create a page within a page (called a sub-page), which can help organize complex projects and keep related content together.Templates \u2014 Notion has a variety of templates for different uses \u2013 from project management to meeting agendas, team wikis, and CRMs. Using these templates makes getting setup and up-to-speed easier than ever.",

Then search for your engineering team's project management database. So, if you're redesigning your website's homepage, you can link all the engineering tasks associated with that project, like code reviews and UX updates.You can use a Relation property to connect meeting notes too. No matter where other tasks or meeting notes are located in Notion, you can collect everything for a project in one place to help your team work more efficiently.Pages where designers see only their tasks \u2014 many designers use individual pages to manage their own work. Inside these pages, you can link a specific view of your team-wide project management board. When a designer updates a task in their personal view, it's reflected in the team-wide project management board (and vice-versa).Type /link and select Create linked database. Search for your project management system and it'll appear right in that designer's page.Then + Add a view, using a Filter to surface only your tasks. This helps you focus while still working toward overall goals. You can also do this in your design wiki, creating a view that shows only projects in motion this week.Tags or views for projects that are open for feedback \u2014 since Notion fosters transparency and collaboration between teams, we've created a tag that lets teammates know we'd like their opinions.In your project management board, create a Select property called \"Feedback,\" and make one of the tags \"RFC\" (request for comment).When you're kicking off a project or just mocked up a spec, you can tag the page RFC and circulate it with the entire team on Slack.
